This is just a code to indicate which measurement is which.,This is the date on which the observation was gathered.,This is the number of days elapsed since the start of the observations. (It's easier to do math with numbers than dates.),This is the measurement of the apparent diameter of the planet Saturn.,This is the x location of Titan relative to the center of Saturn.,This is the y location of Titan relative to the center of Saturn.,"This is how far away Titan appears to be from Saturn, measured as an angle on the sky. ","This is where Titan is in its orbits around Saturn, measured as an angle rotating around the center of Saturn.","This is the number of days elapsed since the start Titan's current orbit around Saturn, assuming a particular orbital period (next column).","This is what we think Titan's orbital period around Saturn is. Change this number to change the values in the ""Time into Orbit"" column."
